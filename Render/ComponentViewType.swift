/// The design pattern in Render is analogous to React.
/// The component is a function that takes data (ComponentStateType) and returns an immutable
/// description of views.
/// Any view that is compliant to 'ComponentViewType' must take a 'state' as input and a optional
/// configuration closure.
/// When 'renderComponent' is called, the component should be rendered using the 'state' as input.
/// - Note: Any view can conform to 'ComponentViewType', not only 'ComponentView'
/// and 'StaticComponentView' subclasses.

  /// Applies the component configuration (as per ViewType extension).
  /// This configuration closure is symmetrical to setting the 'props' in React.
  /// - Note: If your view is a custom 'ComponentViewType' class (Not inheriting from 
  /// BaseComponentView)
  /// then you are expected to store this closure and run it when 'renderComponent' is called.

  /// - Note: Although it is usually the superview, do not assume that is the same thing.
  /// (For example if the component is wrapped inside a cell, the parent view will be the 
  /// CollectionView).
  /// Use this as reference for size calculation.
