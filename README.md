*React-inspired Swift library for writing UIKit UIs.*

[(Swift 2.3 branch here)](https://github.com/alexdrone/Render/tree/swift_2_3)

#Why

From [Why React matters](http://joshaber.github.io/2015/01/30/why-react-native-matters/):

>  [The framework] lets us write our UIs as pure function of their states.
> 
>  Right now we write UIs by poking at them, manually mutating their properties when something changes, adding and removing views, etc. This is fragile and error-prone. [...]
> 
> [The framework] lets us describe our entire UI for a given state, and then it does the hard work of figuring out what needs to change. It abstracts all the fragile, error-prone code out away from us. 

## Installation

### Carthage



To install Carthage, run (using Homebrew):

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Then add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "alexdrone/Render" "master"    
```

#### CocoaPods
You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `Render` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
pod 'Render'
```

#### Manually
1. Download and drop ```/Render``` folder in your project.  
2. Congratulations!

To get the full benefits import `Render` wherever you import UIKit

``` swift
import UIKit
import Render
```

#TL;DR

**Render**'s building blocks are *Components* (described in the protocol `ComponentViewType`).


Despite virtually any `UIView` object can be a component (as long as it conforms to the above-cited protocol),
**Render**'s core functionalities are exposed by the two main Component base classes: `ComponentView` and `StaticComponentView` (optimised for components that have a static view hierarchy).

**Render** layout engine is based on [FlexboxLayout](https://github.com/alexdrone/FlexboxLayout).

This is what a component (and its state) would look like:


```swift

struct MyComponentState: ComponentStateType {
	let title: String
	let subtitle: String
	let image: UIImage  
	let expanded: Bool
}

class MyComponentView: ComponentView {
    
    // The component state.
    var componentState: MyComponentState? {
        return self.state as? MyComponentState
    }
    
    // View as function of the state.
    override func construct() -> ComponentNodeType {
        return ComponentNode<UIView>().configure({
        		$0.style.flexDirection = self.componentState.expanded ? .Row : .Column
            	$0.backgroundColor = UIColor.blackColor()
        }).children([
            ComponentNode<UIImageView>().configure({
				$0.image = self.componentState?.image
				let size = self.componentState.expanded ? self.referenceSize.width : 48.0
				$0.style.dimensions = (size, size)
            }),
            ComponentNode<UIView>().configure({ 
            		$0.style.flexDirection = .Column
            		$0.style.margin = (8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 0.0, 0.0)
            }).children([
                ComponentNode<UILabel>().configure({ 
                		$0.text = self.componentState?.title ?? "None"
                		$0.font = UIFont.systemFontOfSize(18.0, weight: UIFontWeightBold)
                		$0.textColor = UIColor.whiteColor()
                }),
                ComponentNode<UILabel>().configure({
                		$0.text = self.componentState?.subtitle ?? "Subtitle"
                		$0.font = UIFont.systemFontOfSize(12.0, weight: UIFontWeightLight)
                		$0.textColor = UIColor.whiteColor()                
                })
            ]),
         
            // This node will be part of the tree only when expanded == false. *
            when(!self.componentState?.expanded, ComponentNode<UILabel>().configure({
                $0.style.justifyContent = .FlexEnd
                $0.text = "2016"
                $0.textColor = UIColor.whiteColor()
            }))
        ])
    }
    
}

```

[Check playground](Playgrounds/01%20Flexbox%20Components.playground)


The view description is defined by the `construct()` method.

`ComponentNode<T>` is an abstraction around views of any sort that knows how to build, configure and layout the view when necessary.

Every time `renderComponent()` is called, a new tree is constructed, compared to the existing tree and only the required changes to the actual view hierarchy are performed - *if you have a static view hierarchy, you might want to inherit from `StaticComponentView` to skip this part of the rendering* . Also the `configure` closure passed as argument is re-applied to every view defined in the `construct()` method and the layout is re-computed based on the nodes' flexbox attributes. 

The component above would render to:

###Lightweight Integration with UIKit

*Components* are plain UIViews, so they can be used inside a vanilla view hierarchy with *autolayout* or *layoutSubviews*.
Similarly plain vanilla UIViews (UIKit components or custom ones) can be wrapped in a `ComponentNode` (so they can be part of a `ComponentView` or a `StaticComponentView`).

The framework doesn't force you to use the Component abstraction. You can use normal UIViews with autolayout inside a component or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest difference from Facebook's `ComponentKit`.

###Performance & Thread Model

**Render**'s `renderComponent()` function is performed on the main thread. Diff+Layout+Configuration runs usually under 16ms on a iPhone 4S, which makes it suitable for cells implementation (with a smooth scrolling).

###Live Refresh

You can use **Render** with [Injection](https://github.com/johnno1962/injectionforxcode) in order to have live refresh of your components.
Install the injection plugin, patch your project for injection and add this code inside your component class (or in your ViewController):

```swift

class MyComponentView: ComponentView {
	...
	func injected() {
		self.renderComponent()
	}
}

```

###Backend-driven UIs

Given the descriptive nature of **Render**'s components, components can be defined in JSON or XML files and downloaded on-demand.
*The ComponentDeserializer is being worked on as we speak*.


###Components embedded in cells

You can wrap your components in `ComponentTableViewCell` or `ComponentCollectionViewCell` and use the classic dataSource/delegate pattern for you view controller.

#TODO/Help?
There are a number of things that are still left to do.

- Support Swift package manager. 
- Improve performance (I think there's a lot of rooms for improvements!)
- More examples and demos
